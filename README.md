# LeetCode
Solutions from all completed LeetCode problems

In this repository I will documenting my journey through LeetCode challenges. 
There is no particular order in which the questions will be completed; usually by interest and random selection.
My solutions will not always be optial time/memory complexity, however they will be 100% my own.

If there are issues with readability/clarity or the code is not 'pythonic' please pm me - I am looking to improve.
